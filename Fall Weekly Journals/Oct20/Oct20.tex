\section{Work Update}
For the last, two weeks I have been focusing on making progress on the Happiness Index and Clustering Code projects. I took a few days rest during the break and now I feel extremely energized to start back up again (so this is an apology for all the messages and emails I have/will send)!

\subsection{Happiness Index}
I read the two articles you sent my way and I know we are going to talk about preparing visualizations of the data on Thursday so I won't talk too much. 

The article uses 22 degrees C ($~$ 77 degrees F) to establish temperate climates and an index can be used with four absolute deviations from that point of reference. You suggested using WorldClim data for these maps so I was looking at the variables and it seems entirely possible since we have min., max., and average temperature. So, I will be experimenting with those variables tonight (on a low resolution for now)! 

\subsection{Clustering Code}
I sent out a When2Meet to Ryan, Soham and Jishnu to talk about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Important data to include in our clustering code to identify regions where permanant tree crops can potentially grow in the future
    \item The reasonability of finding that data for our intended locations (a flashback to the soil data D:).
    \item Any potential roadblocks with clustering those data sets (different resolutions, etc.).
\end{itemize}
It's midterm season, so everyone is busy. Our best day is Thursday at 4-5pm if you want to join.

\section{Literature Review}

The main get-away from the two articles you provided is that lower-income countries with more demanding climates emphasize survival while higher-income countries with more demanding climates emphasize self-expression. Temperate locations are moderate and don't show to lean on either side. \cite{van2007climates,van2012climate}

I also read older articles by Evert Van de Vliert \cite{van2004colder} and one of the main things that caught my eye was the happiness index he used by Diener so, I'll take a deeper look into this \cite{diener2009factors}.
